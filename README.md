Kaggel Dataset-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/assemelqirsh/covid19-dataset?resource=download
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization exercise aimed at uncovering global and regional trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to transform raw, complex data into clear, actionable insights through systematic analysis and compelling visualizations.

## Key Objectives & Analysis Performed:

## Data Wrangling & Cleaning:

Merged multiple datasets containing time-series data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Handled missing values and ensured data consistency to maintain the integrity of the analysis.

Formatted date columns and aggregated data to facilitate time-based trend analysis.

## Global Trend Analysis:

Tracked the global spread of the virus over time, visualizing the cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.

Identified key milestones, such as when the global case count surpassed significant thresholds.

## Country-Specific Deep Dive (Egypt):

Isolated data for Egypt to perform a detailed regional analysis.

Calculated and visualized the daily new cases, highlighting specific waves and peak infection periods within the country.

Analyzed the fatality and recovery rates over time to understand the pandemic's impact and the healthcare system's response.

## Comparative Analysis:

Compared Egypt's pandemic trajectory and key metrics (like cases per million people) with other countries to provide context on its relative experience.

## Data Visualization:

Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to create a variety of clear and informative visualizations, including:

Line charts to show trends over time.

Bar charts to compare metrics across different countries.

Pie charts to show the proportion of active cases, recoveries, and deaths.

Key Skills Demonstrated: Data Cleaning & Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Time-Series Analysis, Data Visualization, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Deriving Actionable Insights.
